# InformationRetrieval
Project created for the course Information Retrieval and Data Mining.

Tasks:

Aspect 1: Positional Index
Build a positional index for a document collection. The index should map terms to postings lists which include the positions of terms in documents. Every group must implement this aspect as it will be the basis for further aspects. It is highly recommended that the document set used should not be too large so that developing your system can be done efficiently in local memory. 

Aspect 2: Querying
a) Implement full boolean querying supporting AND, OR and NOT.

Aspect 3: Normalization
b) Include the use of soundex to improve recall. Demonstrate the improvement.

Aspect 4: Wild-cards
b) Implement a B-tree over the dictionary to deal with * wild-cards. Allow the use of two or three wild-cards in search terms.
